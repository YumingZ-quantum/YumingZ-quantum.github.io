I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Institute for Quantum Computing](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/) and [Department of Pure Mathematics](https://uwaterloo.ca/pure-mathematics/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), supervised by [William Slofstra](http://elliptic.space/). Previously, I received my bachelor degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2019, under the supervision of [Junde Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/wujunde). I also spent a semester at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) as an undergraduate exchange student (2017).


Research interests
======
I am broadly interested in mathematics of quantum information and computation. Current interests include
- Non-local games, multi-prover interactive proofs with entanglement
- Self-testing and applications in delegation of quantum computation and QKD
- Operator algebras, approximate representation theory
