I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Institute for Quantum Computing](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/) and [Department of Pure Mathematics](https://uwaterloo.ca/pure-mathematics/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), supervised by [William Slofstra](http://elliptic.space/). Previously, I received my bachelor degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2019, under the supervision of [Junde Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/wujunde). I also spent a semester at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) as an undergraduate exchange student (2017).


Research interests
======
I am broadly interested in mathematics of quantum information and computation. Current interests include
- Non-local games, quantum self-testing,  multi-prover interactive proofs with entanglement
- Operator algebras, approximate representation theory


Publications and preprints
======
- An operator-algebraic formulation of self-testing ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11291))\\
    Joint work with Connor Paddock, William Slofstra, and Yangchen Zhou, talk at QIP 2023 ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsFMjlEF7Wk))
    To appear in <em>Annales Henri Poincar√©</em>

- Quantum delegation with an off-the-shelf device ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03448))\\
    Joint work with Anne Broadbent and Arthur Mehta, talk at Qcrypt 2023

- Positivity is undecidable in tensor-product of free algebras (in preparation)\\
    Joint work with Arthur Mehta and William Slofstra
